Short Manual
============

How to play a local game:
1. Click on “Start local game”.
2. Set your settings, e.g. munition per weapon, number of teams, number of figures per team. (NB: Because the level files only have 8 spawn points atm, number of teams · team size my not exceed 8.)
3. Click on “Continue”.
4. The active team is shown in the lower left corner. Use the left/right (or A/D) keys to move the active figure.
5. Press 1, 2, or 3 to select a weapon. Press up/down/left/right (or W/S/A/D) to move the cross hair.
6. Press space to shoot. (NB: The projectile is *very* small atm. When there is no munition for the chosen weapon, nothing happens)
7. When only one team is left, the text in the lower left corner reads “team x won” (you can still try to kill yourself)
8. Close the game window to start a game with the same settings or modify any of them.
